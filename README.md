### [Project Euler's](https://projecteuler.net) Problems

- All solution written in Julia whiteout the use of any third party packages.
- My main goals here are: 1) learn Julia 2) write concise code 3) try / learn FP
- Script must be executed in root directory (`project_euler/`), `dat/` directory contains inputs for some of the problems.
- Code formated with [Julia Formatter](https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl).
- `test_solution.jl` script is used to check all solutions.
